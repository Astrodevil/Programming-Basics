##There are three folders:
1.) Single Linked List
2.) Doubly Linked List
3.) Circular Linked list

Each folder contains a basic implemention of a list(single or doubly or circular) and also there is 2 folders in each list folder(deletion and insertion)

And there is a folder name "Book store mini program"-  In this program you can add book,author name,copies of the book,cost per each, and then you can perform operation like searching book with its name, searching book with its auhtor name, copies you want & print amount and print all the books you have added.
For this program I have implemented single linked list
