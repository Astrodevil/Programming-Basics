Java Stack
The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). 
Java collection framework provides many interfaces and classes to store the collection of objects. One of them is the Stack class that provides different operations 
such as push, pop, search, etc.

In this section, we will discuss the Java Stack class, its methods, and implement the stack data structure in a Java program. But before moving to the Java Stack class 

have a quick view of how the stack works.

The stack data structure has the two most important operations that are push and pop. The push operation inserts an element into the stack and pop operation removes an
element from the top of the stack. Let's see how they work on stack.
