## card game

this is a simple card game in which computer acting as two opponents tries to beat each other.

the logic is, we suffle the cards we generated and than distribute them to the players.

now what is happening is that ....
they both take turns and at each turn they ramove one card from their deck and 
compare it with the card of the other player and who so evers' card has greater value wins that round and
this continues until some one left with no card.

if the compared cards have same value than a situation of war arises,
in which the take another card and who so ever wins keep the all the card on the war. 

## black deck
the main logic of the game is as follows...
1. A standard deck of playing cards has four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades and Clubs) 
2. thirteen ranks (2 through 10, then the face cards Jack, Queen, King and Ace) for a total of 52 cards per deck.
3. Jacks, Queens and Kings all have a rank of 10.
4. Aces have a rank of either 11 or 1 as needed to reach 21 without busting.
so the game is to reach to a total score of 21 with hitting or standing. If you stand than the result will be decleared 
and who so ever wins get the total amount on bet. you can change the bet amount and if user win he gets the double of 
its money.

enjoy :)
