# Steganography

> Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object.  
> In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.  
> Stealing messages from main source is very common these days.  

## Features:

1. It'll help to encrypt the message even without letting any third-person knowing this image is actually a text message

- **We've 2 files here in order to encrypt the image & then decrypt the message hidden inside that image :**
    1. One for encrypting the file. File can be found [here](https://github.com/nitin30kumar/Programming-Basics/blob/main/Python/Projects/Steganography%20Project/encrypt_steganography.py)
    2. One for decrypting the file. File can be found [here](https://github.com/nitin30kumar/Programming-Basics/blob/main/Python/Projects/Steganography%20Project/decrypt_steganography.py)
