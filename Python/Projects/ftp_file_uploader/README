  ## FTP-Tool is a tool that uploads specific files in an specific folder in ftp server 
	made with <3 by Koddi Angelo Evangelista.

  Note: The use of Python3 is highly preferred over Python2. Consider upgrading Python if
				you find yourself still using Python2 today.

	Note: This tool automates the installation of all dependencies.
				So you don't need to manually install python modules. :)))

	## SETTING UP THE FTP SERVER
	- put your hostname in the configs.ini
	- put your ideal working directory in the ftp server

  ## SETTING UP AUTHENTICATION CREDENTIALS
	- encrypt your username and password to base64 here: https://www.base64encode.org/
	- put the encrypted credentials on the configs.ini

	## SETTING UP GLOBAL VARIABLES
	- In src/variables.py:
		- Put the filenames(w/extension) of the file that you want to upload in FILES_TO_GATHER variable.
		- Put the directory path where it belongs in the SPECIFIC_DIRECTORIES variable.
			note: There is two SPECIFIC_DIRECTORIES variable with different path implementations.
						One is for windows/DOS users and one is for unix/unix-like(linux and mac) users. Just uncomment the one that you are working with.


  ## USAGE
	- Run the main.py
		sample usage:
			- python3 main.py
	- Wait until the task is completed and view the outputs in the outputs folder.


	## FILE STRUCTURE
	Note: don't try to modify the file structure of the system.

	|_ outputs/
	|  |_ {date}/ (contains the gathered files)
	|  
	|_ main.py (The one that runs the program.)
	|_ src/ (Where all the business logic goes.)
	|  |_ *.py
	|_ configs.ini (Where you can put all the key-value pairs that need on the ftp athentication)
